## My process

Started by generating an HTML file that included all the info in the required tags. Worked with the Navbar first, for both mobile and desktop versions, then styled everything else using Grid and Flexbox to place content where required.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript


### What I learned

In this project i used Flexbox and some of it properties to take advantage of it's content distribution.

### Continued development

Planning ahead the HTML layout saves time and makes applying styles and DOM manipulation way easier. Will work on writting better, more functional HTML that makes the next parts of development easier.
